# The Standard Library

This is the repository for the Software Defined Radio/DSP-focused version of
The Standard Library, or TSL.

# Building

You will need Python installed. Invoke `./waf configure` to configure the build,
and `./waf build` to build the tools.

The applications will end up in `build/release/bin`. Just invoke them in the usual way.

# Getting Help
